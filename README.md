## CVSS Score Classification Calculator


This is a simple script designed to calculate and classify CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores. 
It specifically focuses on converting CVSS 2.0 scores to CVSS 3.0 scores. 
The CVSS scoring system is used to assess the severity and impact of vulnerabilities in computer systems.

## How to Use

1. Run the script and it will display a welcome message.
2. Enter a CVSS risk score between 0 and 10 when prompted. You can enter decimals as well.
3. The script will classify the CVSS risk score into one of the following categories:
        None: Score of 0.0
        Low: Scores from 0.1 to 3.9
        Medium: Scores from 4.0 to 6.9
        High: Scores from 7.0 to 8.9
        Critical: Scores from 9.0 to 10.0


Please use this script as a tool to assist you in understanding and classifying CVSS scores, but always refer to official documentation and guidelines for comprehensive vulnerability assessments.
